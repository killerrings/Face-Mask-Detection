# Face-Mask-Detection
• This repository consists of files required to deploy a **Deep Learning** Web App created with **ml5.js**.

• A JS client-based library called **p5.js**, which is based on the core principles of processing, has been used for creating the basic graphic layout 

• ml5.js, which is fundamentally a HLL to TensorFlow.js, is used for deployment of Machine Learning in the web browser.

• A pre-trained model called 'mobilenet' from ml5.js  has been used for the implementation of this Deep Learning project wherein the principles of Transfer Learning has been used to train the model through new images.

• Clone this repository to your local computer and train with your own images
```
git clone https://github.com/killerrings/Face-Mask-Detection.git
